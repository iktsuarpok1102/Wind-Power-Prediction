# Forecasting theWind Power Production in Orkney

In this project, I created the Python scripts to fetch data of wind forecasting and power generation, preprocessing them, testing performances of different models and parameters, and saved the model that performed the best. Besides, I also created the script to predict future power generation based on the saved model.

An MLproject was also created in the folder "SVR" to deploy the model locally and on Azure VM.
